# HYDOD Project â€“ Public Disclosure Statement

This document serves as an official public disclosure of the HYDOD (Hydrogen On Demand) project.

The purpose of this project is to promote open research, collaborative development, and freely available technology for the generation of hydrogen fuel using resonance-based electrolysis and signal-controlled drycell systems.

## Intellectual Freedom and Non-Patentability

By publicly disclosing this design, architecture, and method under an open-source license, we assert that:

- The concept and implementation are part of the public domain.
- No individual, company, or institution may claim exclusive rights or file patents on the disclosed designs, code, circuits, or derivative variations thereof.
- The project is released under a license that prioritizes community use and development over commercial monopolization.

## Background and Intent

This work is inspired by historical and contemporary research into electrolysis, particularly methods utilizing:

- High-frequency waveforms
- Pulsed DC
- Resonance tuning
- Phase-locked loops
- Soundwave and electromagnetic modulation

The intent is to maximize hydrogen production efficiency while minimizing energy consumption, using simple, replicable hardware and software.

## Community and Collaboration

Contributors to this project are encouraged to:

- Share improvements and test results
- Avoid rebranding or obscuring the source
- Keep the technology accessible to all
- Use the project for educational, experimental, and sustainable development purposes

## Protection Against Abuse

The original author(s) explicitly prohibit any use of this technology for:

- Weapons development
- Fossil-fuel greenwashing
- Commercial patent trolling
