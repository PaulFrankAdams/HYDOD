## 📘 What Is Being Disclosed

This disclosure pertains to:

- A **resonance-based hydrogen-on-demand system** using a CNANCNANCN… drycell stack
- The **use of low-frequency AC waveforms (e.g., 468 Hz)** to stimulate resonance within the water cell
- Signal generation via **3-phase waveform controllers** (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Teensy)
- The use of an **audio amplifier or digital MOSFET driver circuit** to deliver this signal to the drycell
- Feedback, tuning, and waveform shaping circuitry (including optional PLL-based auto-tune)
- Implementation for both **wet-cell and dry-cell configurations**
- Any hardware layout, code, or variation publicly posted on this repository

## 🧾 Prior Art Reference

This design builds on and publicly references the following prior art:

- **US3629521A – Puharich**: "Method and Apparatus for Splitting Water Molecules"  
- **US20050246059A1 – Meyer**: "Process and Apparatus for the Production of Fuel Gas and the Enhanced Release of Thermal Energy from Gases and Liquids"

We acknowledge that elements of the system — including waveform tuning, gas separation, and signal generation — are found within these public-domain documents.  
HYDODrive extends these concepts by merging them with modern open hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, LattePanda, KiCad-based circuit design) in a **non-commercial and transparent** manner.

## 📢 Public Intent

This project is released **specifically to prevent**:

- Private patenting of amplifier-based resonance hydrogen generation systems
- Exclusive licensing or control by private entities
- Misuse of the technology to restrict public access or increase dependency on centralized energy suppliers

We encourage experimentation and replication. This project is meant to serve **individuals, communities, educators, makers, and humanitarian efforts** focused on sustainable energy.

## 🔐 Legal Protections

This disclosure is timestamped and published as a permanent part of this GitHub repository.  
It is governed by the following legal instruments:

- **CERN-OHL-S v2.0 License**
- **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)** – for documentation and educational materials

> 🚫 **NO PATENTS MAY BE FILED** on this project or any of its derivatives, including any future inclusion of:
> - Audio amplifiers
> - Phase-locked loop (PLL) auto-tuning
> - Tank circuit modifications
> - Signal processor logic
> - Cell array management systems

Any attempt to patent or restrict the disclosed material will be invalidated by this publication and challenged using public prior art.

## 🧬 Our Mission

We believe that clean, safe, resonant water-splitting technologies can help alleviate global energy inequality — and that they belong to **everyone**.

By publishing HYDODrive V2 and all associated work under open-source terms, we ensure this knowledge is permanently **protected from capture**, and permanently **accessible to all**.
