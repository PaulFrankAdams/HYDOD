# HYDODrive Pi v1 ‚Äì Raspberry Pi-Based Hydrogen-On-Demand Driver Board

HYDODrive Pi v1 is an open-source driver board designed to generate efficient resonant signals for a drycell electrolysis stack using a Raspberry Pi. This board focuses on signal generation, timing, and control ‚Äî forming the heart of a modular hydrogen-on-demand system for research, education, and clean energy experimentation.

## ‚ö° Key Features

- Raspberry Pi (GPIO) compatibility
- Single-phase driver stage with support for 3-phase expansion
- Drives a Cathode‚ÄìNeutral‚ÄìAnode (CNA) drycell configuration
- Resonant LC tank circuit operation (based on original patents)
- Screw terminal outputs for cell array and power
- Modular design: expandable per drycell group
- Supports signal-level MOSFET switching for PWM/resonance
- Plug-and-play with optional HAT integration

## üìê Intended Use

This board is designed for:

- Driving resonant drycell electrolysers (CNA stack)
- Testing waveform response (square wave, PWM, sine mod)
- Experimenting with hydrogen production efficiency
- Demonstrating pulse-resonance electrolysis for educational purposes

## üß† Based On

Inspired by:

- US Patent US20050246059A1 (Stanley Meyer)
- Audio-frequency and PLL-controlled experiments (e.g. Puharich, Lawton)
- Practical hydrogen-on-demand implementations (Boyce, etc.)

## üìÇ Included

- KiCad schematic and PCB layout files (`.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb`)
- Pre-routed board files and netlists
- Gerber files for JLCPCB fabrication
- Simulation template for 1-stage in LTSpice
- Basic GPIO code examples (Python, Arduino)
- Project BOM with part numbers
- Printable layout and connection diagrams

## üß™ Simulation Support

The single-stage simulation (fixed 68‚ÄØ¬µF, 1.7‚ÄØmH) models the resonant characteristics of one driver cell, useful for tuning and waveform testing.
