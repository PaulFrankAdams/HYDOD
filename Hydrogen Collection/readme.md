Open-Source Hydrogen Production Efficiency Experiment

Hydrogen collection and data analysis.

"You don't have to believe my results, test them for yourself!"

This project provides a fully documented, open-source platform for conducting and analyzing experiments on various methods of hydrogen gas production, specifically focusing on the time, voltage, and current required to fill a 0.5-liter volume. Built with readily available hobbyist electronics (Arduino, sensors, and a data logging shield), this project aims to foster reproducible research and collaborative exploration in sustainable energy.

üß™ Project Goal
A common criticism of hydrogen as a clean energy solution is the perceived high energy cost of its production. This project directly addresses that skepticism by enabling the precise measurement and comparison of different hydrogen production methods. The primary goal is to create a standardized, repeatable setup for quantifying the energy input required to produce a specific volume of hydrogen. By precisely measuring the electrical input (voltage and current) and the time taken to produce a 0.5-liter volume of hydrogen, we can:

Quantify and compare the energy cost (e.g., Joules per 0.5 Liters) of each method.

Calculate the production rate in liters per minute.

Investigate and demonstrate potentially more efficient, less conventional methods of hydrogen generation.

‚ú® Key Features (Data Collection & Analysis Focused)
Real-time Measurement: Continuously monitors and displays voltage and current of the hydrogen production cell.

Precise Timing: Records the exact time taken to fill a 0.5-liter bottle, triggered by an IR break beam sensor.

Automated Data Logging: All critical data (timestamp, elapsed time, voltage, current, and method used) is automatically saved to a CSV file on an SD card.

Real-Time Clock (RTC): Ensures accurate, persistent timestamps for all logged data, crucial for long-term experiments and analysis.

Method Labeling: Allows you to easily label and categorize each experimental run by the hydrogen production method being tested, simplifying post-experiment comparison.

Open-Source & Reproducible: All hardware schematics, software (Arduino and PyPortal code), and data collection methodologies are openly shared, encouraging others to replicate experiments, verify results, and contribute improvements.

üíª Software Requirements

Arduino Libraries:

LiquidCrystal_I2C (for LCD)

SPI (standard Arduino library for SD card)

SD (standard Arduino library for SD card)

RTClib (by Adafruit, for Real-Time Clock)

üìä Data Collection Process
Assemble Hardware: Follow the detailed breadboard layout guide provided in the project documentation to connect all components to your Arduino and Data Logging Shield.

Prepare SD Card: Format a MicroSD card (FAT16 or FAT32).

Set RTC Time: The first time you use the RTC, you'll need to set its time. In the Arduino sketch (.ino file), uncomment the line rtc.adjust(DateTime(F(__DATE__), F(__TIME__))); in setup(), upload the sketch, then re-comment it out and re-upload. This sets the RTC to your computer's compile time.

Define Experiment Method: In the Arduino sketch, locate the line String currentMethod = "Electrolysis Method A";. Before each new experimental run or when changing your hydrogen production method, update this string (e.g., "Method B - Saltwater", "Method C - Different Electrodes", "Solar Power Test"). This label will be saved with your data.

Upload Arduino Sketch: Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino.

Run Experiment:

Ensure your 0.5-liter bottle is ready in the cylinder.

Flip the master power switch ON (blue LED should light).

Note: The hydrogen production (electrolysis) is assumed to be running continuously, with hydrogen being vented when not collected.

Press the momentary push button. The green LED will light, and the solenoid will open, redirecting the hydrogen flow into the collection vessel. The timer will start.

When the 0.5-liter bottle reaches the top, it will break the IR beam. The red LED will light, the solenoid will close (venting hydrogen again), and the timer will stop.

The final time, voltage, and current will be displayed on the LCD.

Data Logging: Throughout the "RUNNING" phase, the Arduino continuously logs data (Timestamp, Elapsed Time, Voltage, Current, Method) to a new CSV file on the SD card (LOGXXXXX.CSV). A new file is created for each experiment run.

üìà Data Analysis
After completing several experimental runs with different methods:

Retrieve Data: Remove the SD card from the shield and insert it into your computer.

Access CSV Files: You will find a series of LOGXXXXX.CSV files (e.g., LOG00000.CSV, LOG00001.CSV) on the SD card.

Analyze:

Spreadsheet Software: Open the CSV files in programs like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc. You can easily plot Voltage vs. Time and Current vs. Time for each run.

Programming Languages (Python/R): For more advanced analysis and automation, use Python (with libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for plotting) or R.

Key Analysis Points:

Time to Fill: Directly compare the Elapsed_ms for each method to fill 0.5 liters.

Production Rate: Calculate liters per minute: (0.5 Liters / Elapsed_time_in_seconds) * 60.

Energy Consumption: Calculate the instantaneous power (P=V√óI) for each data point. Integrate power over time to find the total energy consumed (Joules or Watt-hours) for each 0.5-liter fill.

Average Voltage/Current: Calculate the average voltage and current during the active filling period for each method.

Efficiency: Quantify energy efficiency per 0.5 liters of H2 produced.
