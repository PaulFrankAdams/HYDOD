# Public Open-Source Disclosure  
**HYDODrive V2: Signal-Enhanced Hydrogen-On-Demand System**  
**Date of Disclosure:** {{Insert date of upload to GitHub}}

---

This document serves as a **formal open-source disclosure** of the **HYDODrive V2** hydrogen-on-demand (HOD) system, including all electrical, electronic, software, and system-level designs published under this repository.

## Purpose

This disclosure is made to ensure that the principles, architecture, and unique methodologies of HYDODrive V2 are permanently in the public domain and **cannot be patented, locked down, or restricted** by any private entity. This release safeguards the design for free, open development by the global community and ensures it will **always remain accessible for humanitarian, educational, and scientific use**.

## Scope

This disclosure covers all aspects of the HYDODrive V2 system, including but not limited to:

- Modular Pi HAT-based signal logic for frequency generation and tuning
- Use of a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and audio-inspired signal processing
- Physical layout for driver and signal board separation
- Drycell integration and resonance tuning principles
- Sound-assisted electrolysis methodologies, including wave shaping
- System architecture involving Raspberry Pi or LattePanda microcomputers
- Adaptation of principles described in public patents (e.g. Puharich, Meyer)

## Originality and Variation

HYDODrive V2 builds upon prior art and combines key innovations drawn from multiple open sources, including:

- Historical patents in water electrolysis (e.g., US3629521A by Puharich)
- Open experimental research (e.g., Lawton, Boyce, and other contributors)
- Modern embedded systems and simulation-based tuning

This system introduces **original variations** not previously disclosed in exact combination, including:

- Integration of signal synthesis on a dedicated Pi HAT
- Driver board modularity for drycell array scaling
- Isolation of signal and power stages
- Use of audio-like waveform shaping for resonant excitation

## Licensing

All content is released under the **CERN Open Hardware License v2 – Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S)**. Any distribution, modification, or commercial use must **also be shared under the same terms**.

## Declaration

By publishing this disclosure publicly on GitHub, I formally place the described invention and all supporting files into the **global commons**.

> No individual, company, or government may claim exclusive rights or ownership over the disclosed invention, either in whole or in part, through copyright, patent, trade secret, or any other mechanism.

## Acknowledgements

This disclosure is made in recognition of the many researchers—past and present—who have contributed to open energy science. May this project support a cleaner, freer, and more self-sufficient future.
